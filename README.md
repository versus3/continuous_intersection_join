# continuous_intersection_join

Continuous Intersection Join on Moving Objects (Version 1.1, 4.5MB).

- With two moving object sets and an object update set. 
- Every object set has 10, 000 objects with uniform distribution in a 1000*1000 space domain. 
- Object velocities follow a uniform distribution with the maximum speed being 1. 
- Every object issues an update every TM timestamps (including source code for the object update generator, 248KB).
