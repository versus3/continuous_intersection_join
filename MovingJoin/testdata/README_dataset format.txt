1, Moving object data file.
Each line of the moving object data file corresponds to a moving object (with an MBR and a VBR) in the following format:

id x0 x1 y0 y1 vx0 vx1 vy0 vy1 time

Here, id denotes the object ID. [x0, x1] and [y0, y1] denote the extents (the MBR) of the object on the x-dimension and the y-dimension, respectively. 
Similarly, [vx0, vx1] and [vy0, vy1] denote the VBR of the object. time denotes the timestamp when the object is created (by default, all objects are created at timestamp 0).

2, Update data file.
Each line of the update data file corresponds to an object update in the following format:

treeID objectID x0 x1 y0 y1 vx0 vx1 vy0 vy1 updateTime

Here, treeID denotes the dataset that the object belongs to. objectID denotes the object ID. <x0, x1, y0, y1> denotes the new MBR of the object. 
<vx0, vx1, vy0, vy1> denotes the new VBR of the object. updateTime denotes the timestamp when the object update is issued.

Note: 
(1) A line with a single character '2' indicates the end of updates of a timestamp.
(2) By default, objects only update their VBRs (so that objects' trajectories are continuous instead of discrete). So <x0, x1, y0, y1> is simply ignored when processing an update. 
(3) By default, an object updates at least once every T_M timestamps. So the update data is generated by (i) generating an update for every object, (ii) uniformly distributing all these object updates in a T_M timestamp period, (iii) at each timestamp, randomly generating some more object updates to meet the update number requirement.
